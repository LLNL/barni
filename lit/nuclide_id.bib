  abstract  = {Gamma spectrum analysis is a standard tool in many fields today. Often
	the task is to find out the exact composition and concentrations
	of radionuclides in a measured spectrum. A full manual identification
	of a complex spectrum requires considerable expertise on the part
	of the laboratory personnel and takes usually several hours.
	
	An expert system coupled with the gamma spectrum analysis system SAMPO
	has been developed for automating the qualitative identification
	of radionuclides as well as for determinating the quantitative parameters
	of the spectrum components. The program is written in C-language
	and runs in various environments ranging from PCs to UNIX workstations.
	The expert system utilizes a complete gamma library with over 2600
	nuclides and 80 000 lines, and a rule base of about fifty criteria
	including energies, relative peak intensities, genesis modes, half-lives,
	parent-daughter relationships etc. The rule base is furthermore extensible
	by the user.
	
	The performance of the expert system has been evaluated using test
	cases from environmental samples, sets of standard sources and activation
	analysis measurements, which have been carefully analyzed manually.
	Also. synthesized spectra have been used, where the exact composition
	of the sample is known in advance. Results from these tests show
	that the expert system performs very well, even for difficult spectra.},

  abstract  = {Radionuclide identification from a measured gamma-spectrum
	is an iterative process, where the analyst aims to find correct nuclides
	by decreasing the amount of possibilities by trial and error. Although
	the process of identification is quite complex, it can be formulated
	using rules of thumb combined with exact mathematical analysis. Thus,
	an expert system can be built, where the knowledge of a human expert
	is converted to explicit rules. In this paper expert system SHAMAN
	is presented, which carriess out the qualitative nuclide identification
	and activity determination with minimum of user intervention. The
	reasoning process is performed by an inference engine written in
	C-language. The system uses a database containing over 2000 radionuclides
	with about 48 000 gamma-transitions. Spectra are provided in preprocessed
	format, where peak energies, intensities and backgoounds with respective
	error estimates have been calculated by a separate analysis program.},

  abstract = {Radioisotope identification using a plastic scintillation detector has been a challenging issue because of the poor spectral resolution and low cross-sections of these types of detectors when used for photoelectric absorption. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that identifies a single radioisotope and multiple radioisotopes from the gamma spectrum of a plastic scintillator using an artificial neural network. The spectra were simulated using Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code 6 to formulate the training set, and the spectra were measured by a two-inch EJ-200 to create the test set (1440 spectra in total). The ANN-based algorithm presented here ensures an identification accuracy of 98.9% for a single radioisotope and 99.1% for multiple radioisotopes. Even if the spectra were intentionally shifted by 36â¯keV for low and high energies, the trained ANN predicts radioisotopes with high accuracy. In addition, we have determined the minimal required number of detected counts to identify the radioisotope with 5% false negative and false positive.},

Rapid measurement of considerable fluctuation and noise in gamma-ray spectra causes difficulties in nuclide identification. Current methods require noise removal, background subtraction, feature extraction, and the information of low-count channels may be lost during these processes. In this study, we developed a rapid nuclide identification method based on convolutional neural network (CNN). A dataset was constructed using simulation method for CNN training. The algorithm was evaluated with different gamma-ray spectra measured under different times, distances, and mixed radioactive sources. Results showed that the algorithm has high recognition accuracy for low count rate gamma-ray spectra, and which can be used to improve the identification performance of rapid radiation monitoring.},

  abstract  = {Traditional radionuclide identification algorithm based on peak detection cannot recognize radioactive material in a short time. This study proposes a rapid radionuclide identification algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform and error back propagation neural network. Detection rate and accurate radionuclide identification distance were used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the extracted feature vector of the spectrum is not influenced by time, activity, and distance. The proposed algorithm obtained better results in a relatively authentic environment, and it has the ability to predict the isotopic compositions of the mixed spectrum. The proposed method has a better identification performance for the spectrum of radionuclide masked by shielding material except the gamma rays emitted by related radionuclide are significantly shielded. It is also particularly recommended for the fast radionuclide identification of spectroscopic radiation portal monitors, radioisotope identification devices, and other radiation monitoring instruments.},

  abstract  = {There is a need to develop an algorithm that can determine the relative activities of radioisotopes in a large data set of low-resolution gamma-ray spectra that contain a mixture of many radioisotopes. Low-resolution gamma-ray spectra that contain mixtures of radioisotopes often exhibit feature overlap, requiring algorithms that can analyze these features when overlap occurs. While machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have shown promise for the problem of radioisotope identification, their ability to identify and quantify mixtures of radioisotopes has not been studied. Because machine-learning algorithms use abstract features of the spectrum, such as the shape of overlapping peaks and Compton continuum, they are a natural choice for analyzing radioisotope mixtures. An artificial neural network (ANN) has been trained to calculate the relative activities of 32 radioisotopes in a spectrum. The ANN is trained with simulated gamma-ray spectra, allowing easy expansion of the library of target radioisotopes. In this paper, we present our initial algorithms based on an ANN and evaluate them against a series of measured and simulated spectra.},

  abstract  = {An algorithmic approach has been adopted for many years for identifying and quantifying radioisotopes in high-resolution gamma-ray spectra. Complexity of the technique, particularly when used with lower resolution detectors, warrants looking for machine-learning alternatives where intensive computations are required only during training, while actual sample analysis is greatly simplified. This should be advantageous in developing simple portable systems for fast online analysis of large numbers of samples, particularly in situations where accuracy can be traded off for speed and simplicity. Solutions based on neural networks have been reported in the literature. This paper describes the use of abductive networks which offer shorter training times and a simpler and more automated approach to model synthesis. The Abductory Induction Mechanism (AIM)1 tool was used to build models for determining isotopes in both single-and multiple-isotope samples represented by spectra from an NaI (Tl) detector. Inspite of a 50-fold poorer resolution for the AIM spectral data, AIM results are adequate, with average errors ranging between 11.8% and 20.5% for a number of simulated multi-isotope cocktails.},

  abstract = {Portal radiation monitors dedicated to the prevention of illegal traffic of nuclear materials at international borders need to deliver as fast as possible a radionuclide identification of a potential radiological threat. Spectrometry techniques applied to identify the radionuclides contributing to γ-emitter mixtures are usually performed using off-line spectrum analysis. As an alternative to these usual methods, a real-time processing based on an artificial neural network and Bayes’ rule is proposed for fast radionuclide identification. The validation of this real-time approach was carried out using γ-emitter spectra (241Am, 133Ba, 207Bi, 60Co, 137Cs) obtained with a high-efficiency well-type NaI(Tl). The first tests showed that the proposed algorithm enables a fast identification of each γ-emitting radionuclide using the information given by the whole spectrum. Based on an iterative process, the on-line analysis only needs low-statistics spectra without energy calibration to identify the nature of a radiological threat.},
